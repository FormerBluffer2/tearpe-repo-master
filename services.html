          <p>I am an attorney with experience in a wide range of general corporate areas. Click here to see more information <a href="about-us.html">about me</a>. I believe that the most effective way for me to provide assistance to your organization is for me to work closely with the individuals who actually need the help. By working closely with these individuals, I can provide assistance that is tailored to the situation and meets the needs of the business.</p>
          <p>Today, corporate legal departments are faced with relentless pressure to meet the increasing demands for top-quality legal services. At the same time, these services are expected to be performed in a cost-effective manner and completed in an environment with significant headcount restrictions.  As a result, it is more common for businesses to look for individuals who can act as an extension of existing legal teams and help add value to the business. Outsourcing legal tasks to experienced individuals helps businesses augment their internal capabilities in a cost-effective manner.</p>
          <p>I recognize that not all business needs are the same. That is why I am able to offer a variety of flexible arrangements to help meet your needs. For example, if you need help on a specific business development project I can help with the transaction. However, if you find that you simply need help keeping up with ongoing general contract reviews, I can help with that too. My goal is to seamlessly deliver services to meet your needs.  Please continue reading to see some examples of how I might be able to help.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <p>I can assist with strategic transactions such as M&A, joint ventures, product development, technology licenses, equity investment, distribution and other business development agreements. My in-house background brings practical experience that is very helpful in negotiating the best agreement that incorporates real-world business experience.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contract negotiation assistance, including helping to establish negotiating strategies and draft documents</li>
            <li>Assist with the implementation of strategic transactions, including creating working documents to help individuals understand their responsibilities under the agreements</li>
            <li>Support ongoing interpretation and assist with changes that may be necessary to reflect unanticipated situations or changes in circumstances</li>

          <p>General contract review to support the general needs of the business, including confidentiality, research and consulting agreements, software development and license agreements, equipment and material supply purchases, etc. This can be additional support to help with overflow work or to free up in-house resources for other responsibilities. Businesses often find themselves overwhelmed with contract review requirements.  The high volume of routine contracts and the time needed to draft and review them may mean that the contracts do not get the attention they deserve or can distract resources from more significant projects.  Delegating these high-volume, time-intensive projects frees up your in-house resources to concentrate on higher value tasks while still providing high quality services.</p>

            <li>Support for high volume specialty projects such as clinical trials, major construction projects, etc.</li>
