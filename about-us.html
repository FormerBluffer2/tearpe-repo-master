        <p>I am an attorney with experience in a wide range of general corporate areas.  My experience has been primarily with technology based companies, including pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and includes Fortune 500 senior management positions. Over time, I have discovered that more and more issues arise, either directly or indirectly, from areas that involve computer technology regardless of the industry.  As a result, I have begun teaching myself computer coding as a way to improve my understanding of these issues as well as for personal enrichment.</p>
        <p>In addition to my professional background, I have a wide range of interests that vary from playing hockey to volunteering with an organization that provides recreational opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>

        <p>I went to law school at the University of Illinois College of Law in Champagne, Illinois, where I graduated Cum Laude. As an undergraduate, I went to Northern Illinois University where I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a degree in Accounting. Although I never practiced as an accountant, I did successfully pass both the Certified Public Accounting (CPA) and Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) Examinations. I have found that my accounting background has been particularly helpful working in a corporate environment.</p>

          <p>Although I don't have formal education in any of the following areas, I have had an interest in these areas for as long as I can remember:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Engineering - If I had to do it over (and my high school grades were better), I might go to school to become a mechanical engineer. I've always been curious to learn about new technologies and to understand how things work.</li>
            <li>Astronaut - I still have hopes of one day being an astronaut and am excited about the renewed interest in space travel.</li>

        <p>I am always open to learn new things. That is one of the reasons I am taking the time to build this website. Even though I am not likely to ever become an expert computer coder, I hope I will be able to learn enough to build a website that can become a useful resource. I am always open to constructive feedback, so please don't hesitate to let me know what you think of this website. In particular, I would be happy to receive any suggested changes or additions. Thank you.</p>
